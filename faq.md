# Product Questions

## Where can I find the latest versions of Lego Digital Designer?
The Windows version is still available here (MD5 Checksum: 1234).
The OS X version version is still available here (SHA1 checksum: CAB24D575BA4A62672C2E7A7CE45C8A55CD3BF3A).
A mirror on google drive is also available here

## What about support for other applications or formats like MLCAD, LDraw or Stud.io?

I track other applications and formats. An important aspect of LegoToR version 0.4.8.1 has been re-engineering specifically support USD. I understand the power and capabilities of applications and formats such as MLCAD, LDraw or Stud.io, and the strong interest in them. As LegoTor is completely open-source I encourage a fork or pull requests to make that happen.
